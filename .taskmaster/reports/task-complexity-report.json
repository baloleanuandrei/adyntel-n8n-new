			"reasoning": "Very low complexity task - involves deleting a single duplicate credentials file that has no references in the codebase. The file is identical to the main AdyntelApi.credentials.ts and is not referenced in package.json or used by any nodes. Simple file deletion with verification steps."

			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this cleanup task into verification, deletion, testing, and validation steps to ensure no build system dependencies are broken when removing the duplicate node directory.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity task involving directory deletion with multiple files (node.ts, node.json, svg). Requires careful verification that no build system references exist, testing the build process, and confirming the main Adyntel node remains functional. The task has clear steps but involves multiple file types and build system validation."

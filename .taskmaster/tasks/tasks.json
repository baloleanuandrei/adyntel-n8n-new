The file at /Users/andreibaloleanu/adyntel-n8n-new/credentials/adyntelPicsApi.credentials.ts contains the same AdyntelApi class as the main credentials file\n2. The adyntelPics node in nodes/adyntelPics/adyntelPics.node.ts references 'AdyntelApi' credentials, not 'adyntelPicsApi'\n3. The package.json only registers the main AdyntelApi credentials file in the n8n configuration\n4. No references to 'picsapi', 'adyntelPicsApi', or similar variants were found in the codebase\n\nImplementation steps:\n1. Verify the file is truly unused by conducting a final search for any references\n2. Delete the adyntelPicsApi.credentials.ts file using the file system\n3. Ensure no import statements or configuration references point to this file\n4. Confirm the adyntelPics node continues to work with the main AdyntelApi credentials\n\nThis cleanup will reduce code duplication and eliminate confusion about which credentials file to use for the Adyntel API integration.",
